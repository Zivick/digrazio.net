This is a simple portfolio style website which I am sure everyone is very familiar with.

Not a whole lot going on, just trying to brush up on my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.
I'm also dabbling in new concepts for me such as Bootstrap, Node.js and Express.

Feel free to give me some pointers or make fun of my spaghetti code, it won't hurt my feelings.
In fact it will probably help me out a lot, I really could use any constructive criticism I can get.
